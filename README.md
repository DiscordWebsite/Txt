# txt.discord.website
This site is used to view text files that have been uploaded to Discord.
The site is static; the data loading and formatting is performed clientside.
Deleting the original file from Discord will also prevent loading it with this site.

## Example
Link to a text file uploaded to Discord:
> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/147698382092238848/506154212124786689/example.txt

Take the relevant substring (channel id, attachment id, and attachment name):
> 147698382092238848/506154212124786689/example.txt

Add as a query parameter:
> https://txt.discord.website?file=147698382092238848/506154212124786689/example.txt

For raw (non-formatted) output, append `&raw=true`:
> https://txt.discord.website?file=147698382092238848/506154212124786689/example&raw=true

<details>
<summary>Deprecated use of .txt attachments</summary>
`file=` is prioritized over the `txt=` parameter, i.e. when both are present, `file=` parameter
will take effect.
